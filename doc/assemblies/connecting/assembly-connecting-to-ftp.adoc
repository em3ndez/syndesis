= Connecting to an FTP or SFTP server
:context: ftp

In an integration, you can connect to an FTP or SFTP server to download or 
upload files. To do this, create an FTP or SFTP connection and then add  
it to an integration flow. 

For the first step in an integration, you can download files that you define with an Apache Camel File Language expression.

For the middle or last step in an integration, you can upload files that you define with an Apache Camel File Language expression. For an FTP server only, you can also download or upload a named file (where the previous step in the integration provides the name of the file).
