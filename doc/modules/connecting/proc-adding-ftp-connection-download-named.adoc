= Obtaining a named file from an FTP server

In an integration, you can download a specific file from an FTP server in the middle of a flow or to finish a simple integration. To do this, add an FTP connection to the middle of a flow or as a simple integrationâ€™s finish connection.  

.Prerequisites
* You created an FTP connection. 
* You are creating or editing a flow and {prodname} is prompting you
to add to the integration. Or, {prodname} is prompting you to choose a finish connection. 

.Procedure
. On the *Add to Integration* page, click the plus sign where you 
want to add the connection. Skip this step if {prodname} is
prompting you to choose the finish connection. 
. Click the FTP connection that you want to use to download files. 
. On the *Choose an action* page, select *DownloadNamedFile*.
. In the *Delete after download* field, accept the default of *No* or select *Yes* to download the file and then delete it from the server. 
. In the *FTP directory* field, enter the absolute or relative name of a server directory. At runtime, the connection watches this directory for the named file and downloads it when it finds it. 
. Click *Next*. 

.Result
The connection appears in the integration visualization where you added it.
